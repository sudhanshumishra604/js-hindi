DAY-1 VIDEO-1

JAVASCRIPT IS DYNAMICALLY TYPED THAT MEANS VARIABLE CAN STORE ANY VALUE OF ANY DATATYPE LIKE 1,A,EWDWE ETC.
VARIABLES NAMES ARE CASE SENSITIVE.
const , let are like area  specifiers.
let can be updated not redeclared like var . dont use var it is not good.
ES (ECMA SCRIPT) come after 2015 with new feature of const and let.
 variable with let keyword if not initialized with any value than it return undefined as output..
 const variable if not initialized than return error..
 ojects are the collection of values{key:value}.. see objects.js 
 CONST CAN NOT BE CHANGED AND DECLARED AGAIN BUT IN CASE OF OBJECT IT CAN BE..

 DAY-2 VIDEO-2

JUST LEARN OPERATORS IN JS SAME LIKE IN JAVASCRIPT
 === AND !== ARE COMPARE AND ALSO ITS TYPE COMPARISON
 SOME CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS IF ELSE SWITCH AND OR ETC..
 ALERT IS JUST FOR POP UP ON WEB PAGE..
 PROMPT IS LIKE ALERT FOR POPUP BUT IT ALSO TAKES INPUT..

DAY-3 VIDEO-3

JUST LEARN NEW LOOPS IN JAVASCRIPT LIKE FOR AND WHILE AND DO-WHILE LOOPSSS
THERE IS FOR-OF LOOP USED FOR TRAVERSING STRING VARIABLES (FOR-INLOOP.JS)
THERE IS A FOR-IN LOOP FOR FINDING ALL KEYS IN OBJECT...
TEMPLATE LITERALS IN JS LIKE `` is better than ""...
STRING :-
escaple characters = /n , /t 
YOU CANNOT MODIFY THE ORIGNAL STRING AT ALL YOU NEED TO MAKE NEW VARIABLE FOR TO STOREB CHANGES..
STRING.LENGTH,STRING.UPPERCASE ALL METHODS IN JS.
string concat string slice ,trim etc..

DAY-4 VIDEO-4

ALL ABOUT ARRAY
HOW TO DECLARE ARRAY.
data in array are linearly stored.
IT IS USED TO STORE SAME TYPE OF ITEMS.
IT IS TYPEOF IS OBJECT 
LOOPING IS SAME AS IN JAVA  (array.js)
FOR-OF LOOP AND FOR-IN CAN BE USED.
Push AND POP method in string to add and delete element in array.
tostring method in array .
unshift method to add element in start of array.
shift method to delete element of start.

DAY-5 VIDEO-5

FUNCTION AND METHODS
HOW TO DECLARE FUNCTION AND PARAMETERS OF IT.
FUNCTION KEYWORD USED TO DECLARE AND ELSE IS SAME AS JAVA.
ARROW FUNCTION :- COMPACT WAY OF WRITTING FUNCTION (FUNCTION.JS)
ARROW FUNCTION has a variable that stores value function.
METHODS ARE LIKE FUNCTION BUT THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH OBJECT.
like uppercase method only used for string.
FOR- EACH METHOS IS ONLY USED FOR ARRAY.
FOR EACH TAKES FUNCTION AS PARAMETER TO TRAVERSE ARRAY.
FOR EACH HAVE DEFAULT WAY TO PRINT INDEX AND ARRAY ALSO IF PASS AS ARGUMENT (FUNCTION.JS)
HIGH ORDER FUNCTION/METHOD (HOF) ARE FUNCTION WHICH TAKE OTHER FUNCTION AS PARAMETER OR Return function .
map method in array is just like FOR-EACH loop  it returns new array.
filter method is another method for array to filter array with given conditions and return new array.

DAY-6 VIDEO-6

DOM(Document object model)
Learn about html,css and js and how to link all with each other.
for css:- link tag used and for JAVASCRIPT:- script tag used.
Window Object :- Its a global object with lots of properties and methods. Already present in browser.  like alert, console.log etc..(they arfe browsers object not javascript object..)
What is DOM?  :-  its a technique to access html in javascript.
DOM is used for dynamic change in webpage as we cannot change html ,css again and again so js is used for dynamic changes like darkmode when click on button.
we can access html by window object with documnet in it.
we learn about how can we access html and css both using only javascript. 
Methods like queryselector , getelementbyclass , append,prepand etc.

DAY-7 VIDEO-7

Learn some new DOM Manipulation methods like:
to access attribute getAttribute.
to change its attribute.
to create element for adding use createElement.

DAY-8 VIDEO-8

WE Learn about EVENTS which do something change in webpage.
onclick attribute used for change when clicked on button..
there is another event handling attribute which is ondblclick.
these are all inline event handling.
we can also handle event using javascript using arrow function using events attribute in js.
javascript event handling have more priority than inline handling .
To access event object like event attribute. target , tags where event happening we can use  e,evet,event in arrow function..
EVENT LISTNERS is another method for event handling besides other methods.
here in event listners we use Node.addEventListners(event,callback func); and another is removeeventlisners();
IT takes function to do a event as argument.

DAY-9 ViDEO-9 

Made a project on tic tac toe  (tictactoe)

DAY-11  VIDEO-11

CLAsses and Object:-

we already learn how to make object previously (object.js).
Javascript objects having state and behaviour (property and method).
prototypes are present in object which contain some predefined method like concat,toString,typeof etc..
__proto__ can be used to assign any function to other function.
Classes are template for creating objects .ITs sae like in java.
constructor is called using constructor keyword.
Inheritance can also be done using extends keyword.
there is a concept of super() used to use constructor of parent function. Without we cannot access parent constructor in child class.
file handling using try-catch block.
