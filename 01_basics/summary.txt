JAVASCRIPT IS DYNAMICALLY TYPED THAT MEANS VARIABLE CAN STORE ANY VALUE OF ANY DATATYPE LIKE 1,A,EWDWE ETC.
VARIABLES NAMES ARE CASE SENSITIVE.
const , let are like area  specifiers.
let can be updated not redeclared like var . dont use var it is not good.
ES (ECMA SCRIPT) come after 2015 with new feature of const and let.
 varibale with let keyword if not initialized with any value than it return undefined as output..
 const varible if not initialized than return error..
 ojects are the collection of values{key:value}.. see objects.js
