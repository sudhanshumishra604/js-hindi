DAY-1 VIDEO-1

JAVASCRIPT IS DYNAMICALLY TYPED THAT MEANS VARIABLE CAN STORE ANY VALUE OF ANY DATATYPE LIKE 1,A,EWDWE ETC.
VARIABLES NAMES ARE CASE SENSITIVE.
const , let are like area  specifiers.
let can be updated not redeclared like var . dont use var it is not good.
ES (ECMA SCRIPT) come after 2015 with new feature of const and let.
 variable with let keyword if not initialized with any value than it return undefined as output..
 const variable if not initialized than return error..
 ojects are the collection of values{key:value}.. see objects.js 
 CONST CAN NOT BE CHANGED AND DECLARED AGAIN BUT IN CASE OF OBJECT IT CAN BE..

 DAY-2 VIDEO-2

JUST LEARN OPERATORS IN JS SAME LIKE IN JAVASCRIPT
 === AND !== ARE COMPARE AND ALSO ITS TYPE COMPARISON
 SOME CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS IF ELSE SWITCH AND OR ETC..
 ALERT IS JUST FOR POP UP ON WEB PAGE..
 PROMPT IS LIKE ALERT FOR POPUP BUT IT ALSO TAKES INPUT..

DAY-3 VIDEO-3

JUST LEARN NEW LOOPS IN JAVASCRIPT LIKE FOR AND WHILE AND DO-WHILE LOOPSSS
THERE IS FOR-OF LOOP USED FOR TRAVERSING STRING VARIABLES (FOR-INLOOP.JS)
THERE IS A FOR-IN LOOP FOR FINDING ALL KEYS IN OBJECT...
TEMPLATE LITERALS IN JS LIKE `` is better than ""...
STRING :-
escaple characters = /n , /t 
YOU CANNOT MODIFY THE ORIGNAL STRING AT ALL YOU NEED TO MAKE NEW VARIABLE FOR TO STOREB CHANGES..
STRING.LENGTH,STRING.UPPERCASE ALL METHODS IN JS.
string concat string slice ,trim etc..

DAY-4 VIDEO-4

ALL ABOUT ARRAY
HOW TO DECLARE ARRAY.
data in array are linearly stored.
IT IS USED TO STORE SAME TYPE OF ITEMS.
IT IS TYPEOF IS OBJECT 
LOOPING IS SAME AS IN JAVA  (array.js)
FOR-OF LOOP AND FOR-IN CAN BE USED.
Push AND POP method in string to add and delete element in array.
tostring method in array .
unshift method to add elemr=ent in start of array.
shift method to delete element of start.

DAY-5 VIDEO-5

FUNCTION AND METHODS
HOW TO DECLARE FUNCTION AND PARAMETERS OF IT.
FUNCTION KEYWORD USED TO DECLARE AND ELSE IS SAME AS JAVA.
ARROW FUNCTION :- COMPACT WAY OF WRITTING FUNCTION (FUNCTION.JS)
ARROW FUNCTION has a variable that stores value function.
METHODS ARE LIKE FUNCTION BUT THEY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH OBJECT.
like uppercase method only used for string.
FOR- EACH METHOS IS ONLY USED FOR ARRAY.
FOR EACH TAKES FUNCTION AS PARAMETER TO TRAVERSE ARRAY
FOR EAC HAVE DEFAULT WAY TO PRINT INDEX AND ARRAY ALSO IF PASS AS ARGUMENT (FUNCTION.JS)
HIGH ORDER FUNCTION/METHOD (HOF) ARE FUNCTION WHICH TAKE OTHER FUNCTION AS PARAMETER OR Return function .
map method in array is just like FOR-EACH loop . it returns new array.
filter method is another method for array to filter array with given conditions and return new array.
